This is an opportunity to work with databases

In a new package, write a module to implement a database table for 'posts'
Use the following API to grab a very large number of 'posts':
  https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

##### Details:

* Write a module which will add a new table to your existing database 
(you only need to run this once)
* Decide on a name for your table, such as 'posts'
* This new table needs columns for 'id' 'userId' 'title' and 'body'
(id should be the primary key)
* Decide on suitable SQL data types for these fields (e.g. VARCHAR(256) for 'body')
* Write a module which will read the JSON data for all the 'posts' from the API url. 
Then iterate over the retrieved data to populate your new table
* In another module, ask the user which userId they are interested in. 
* Remember - input ALWAYS returns a string, so cast it to an int(float(str))
Then retrieve and display all the database records for that userId (use a 'WHERE' clause in the SQL)
(You will need to validate that the userId is a positive integer within bounds)
CAREFUL - userId is a number, so don't use quotes in the SQL statement

##### Architecture:

Use classes, functions and/or modules as you see fit

Once the initial database has been created, write code to encapslate neat ways to:

- create a new (valid) 'post' item
- update existing 'post' items, e.g. changing the value of 'title' or 'body'

##### Optional:

* Populate a new database table with the 'todos' from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos
* Find ways to re-use existing code
* Find a way to show only 'completed' todo items for a given userId
* Show all todos AND posts for a given userId
* Find all the incomplete todos and set them to completed
* Consider how you could make a utility module to reset the database to a 'known-good' state
* How could you persist the same data into a text file (and retrieve it)
