### Advanced Python Review Exercise 1 45 mins, until 2:25

Write an abstract base class with a property 'n' and a __str__ method

In a new module write a class called 'NumberFun' inheriting from your abstract base class

In the __init__ method of NumberFun, provide the property as expected by the Abstract Base Class

This property will be validated as a positive integer

Write decorated methods to get and set the property

Invalid entries should default to 1 (or thow an exception)

Use 'name-mangling' for the actual property __n

Write methods to return the square of 'n' and the square root of 'n'   
( sqrt = n**0.5 # returns square root of n )

Declare a __str__ method which returns the number, the square of the number and the square root

Exercise the code to show it works as expected ( if __name__ ...)

Try to access the name-mangled property directly from outside an instance of the class.

e.g.    t = myInst.__n # (should fail)

See if you can set a value for this name-mangled property

e.g.    myInst.__n = 99 # this seems to work but...

At the end, some of you may like to show what you built

#### Optional

Write a method in your class which finds out if the integer is odd or even
Write another method which finds out if the number is itself a square number
Use these functions in your __str__ method

Extend your class into a new class that also takes a boolean value
If the boolean is set to True, your __str__ method should also show todays date

Also write a __repr__ method
