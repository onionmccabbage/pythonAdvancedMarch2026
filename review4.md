### Advanced Python Review 4 

one hour (until tea break at 3:00)


- Alter these instructions to suit your thinking
- Aim for good architecture (maybe use separate modules)
- Look online, talk to each other, ask me etc.
- There will be an opportunity to share your code
- If you wish, try async programming

* Write a 'Weather' class with get/set methods for 'city' and 'description'
* In a separate thread (e.g. another class or function), use the 'requests' library to get data from
*   https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=athlone&units=metric&APPID=48f2d5e18b0d2bc50519b58cce6409f1
* (this ID will work up to 60 requests a minute)
* Use the response data to populate an instance of your Weather class
* For this API JSON data, the description will be
*  response_dict['weather'][0]['description']
* NB there is no expectation to retrieve EVERY data-point
* In your Weather class, override __str__ so the class prints nicely, something like
  'The weather in Athlone is cloudy'

* Your Weather class should validate:
  - the value for 'city' is a non-empty string of three or more characters
  - if city is missing or unacceptable, you should provide a sensible default (e.g. 'Athlone')
  - the description should be a non-empty string
* Write try-except blocks around some of your code (e.g. the api access)

##### Optional

* When requesting the weather, pass in the 'city' value as a parameter for the API
*  f'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&units=metric&APPID=48f2d5e18b0d2bc50519b58cce6409f1'
* The 'city' could be a sys.argv or user input value, but always provide a default
* Add a property to your Weather class for 'temperature' (a floating point number)
* Use the returned data to populate values for temperature in your Weather instance
* The temperature value will be
*  response_dict['main']['temp'] (show other data if you wish)
*  Make a number of concurrent Weather requests for different cities (there is no need for locking)

##### If time

* Append the weather-data properties to a text file (or byte file)
* You culd make the file-writing happen on it's own thread (though it is I/O bound)
* You could also encapsulate errors in a class too

##### Super Optional

* Add 'weather' functionality to your microservice or Flask app from before
* This will let you grab many weather reports in one go (on separate threads)
* e.g. the client asks for a city, then the server gets the data and responds
