## Python Advanced

#### 23-26 March 2026

Toby Dussek

You will need:
- Python 3.x
- an editor (e.g. VS Code, PyCharm etc.)
- internet, with permission to install python libraries (e.g. requests library)

Python code lives in classes (or in functions), in modules, which live in packages (folders)

*  9:30 start
* 11:00 break (15 mins)
* 12:00 lunch (1 hr)
* 3:00 break (15 minutes)
*  4:30 end

Monday
- intro and welcome
  - what you currently know
  - what you want to know 
- abstract and concrete classes
- class inheritance
- using slots
- Anything __nnn__ is a built in feature of Python. Called 'dunder'
- name-mangled members
- can we actually access __nnn properties
- property decorators
- validate data types: isinstance, type, int(float())
- override built-in methods: __str__, __repr__, __eq__ etc.
- if __name__== '__main__'
- how to load a relative file path
- using sys.path
- after lunch review: build class(es) with properties and methods
- functional programming: map, filter and reduce  
- function parameters: args, kwargs

Tuesday
- how to accessing the recordings
- loading remote API data (requests)
- processing text/json
- persisting files: read/write/append/exclusive/overwrite, text, bytes, json
- 'with' operator for clean handling of assets
- how to convert bytes back to string: b'this is bytes'.decode()
- Remember - in Python EVERYTHING is an OBJECT
- databases and SQL
    see https://wiki.python.org/moin/DatabaseProgramming
- also useful: add 'sqlite viewer' plugin to VSCode
- overview of other db connections
- see SQL tutorial https://www.w3schools.com/sql/
- Create, Read and Update (and Delete) - CRUD operations
- populate db with sample data
- read and nicely format values from the db
- after lunch review exercise

Wednesday
- comprehensions, generators and yield
- i/o bound means any program which relies on external assets (print, input....)
- python includes stdin and stdout
- redirect stdout
- context manager to switch context e.g. for handling data input and output
- networking server/client (microservices)
- immediate-mode Python
- Testing: (only really works if there is a good spec')
  - doctest revisited
  see https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html
  - unittest see https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html
  - pytest see https://docs.pytest.org/
- after lunch lab exercise
- Flask is a lightweight web server
  (django is a full-fat web server)

Thursday
- profiling: timings etc. (cProfile)
  to use cProfile we write this:
     python -m cProfile -o prof_out using_api.py
- debug
- classes include several really useful methods we may override:
  __init__, __str__, __repr__, __enter__, __exit__, __run__, __call__
- multithreading, also limits of mutlithreading concurrency
  - class and function threads
  - how threads are done
  - concurrency and resources (lock shared resources)
  - async await
  in Python we do not get true parallelism ...
- the global Interpreter Lock (GIL)
- Python 3.13 contains an optional GIL
  see https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/
- using thread locks
- Python has -O to optimize code (especially useful for threading and large code-base)
- after lunch review
- async server and client for microservices
- Numpy and Pandas are written in c so they avoid the GIL
- the next course covers:
  - design patterns
  - extend threading and also multiprocessing
  - Numpy, Pandas and Data Analysis

where to go from here:
- use Python
- work through the tutorials and exercises learnpython.org and pynative
